# Library-Database
Create a record of your library of books...
This program utilizes a Book class that contains attributes such as the title of the book,
name of the author, the year published, and whether it is checked out or not. This program 
also contains another class called Library that has a vector called "library" of type "Book" 
and stores all Book objects. In this program you can add, remove, or say if a book in a library is
checked out or not. You can also print out the whole library and look at the details of each book.
